        <h4>Hey! üëãüèº</h4>
        <hr>

            I'm a nerd from the Netherlands. I am curious, communicative, always looking to learn and eager to try
            new and challenging things. My professional interest revolves mainly around computers with a focus on security,
            networking and infrastructure. Other than that I also love to build my own PC, play video games, learn about
            (astro)physics and do some photography.

            I love to go outside.Ô∏è I try to work out multiple times a week by climbing and other activities. I enjoy
            traveling, and try to go on a winter sports and/or diving vacation at least once a year. In 2020, I took three
            months off to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonathanjuursema/albums/72157712706245321" target="_blank">go
            to New Zealand</a> and travel around in a converted campervan.

            During my studies I've spent a lot of time I should have spent studying getting involved in various associations and
            organisations. Even though it's been some time since I graduated I still feel connected to many of them and I try to
            help whenever I can.
