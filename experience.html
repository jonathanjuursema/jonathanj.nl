                            I'm currently working on an internal infrastructure platform that produces repeatable
                            infrastructure deployments using infrastructure as code. Our main mission is to enable our
                            development teams to assume operational responsibility of their own products without having
                            to have extensive experience in infrastructure engineering.
                            To achieve this, we've built a platform of infrastructure-as-code modules that teams can
                            customize and deploy in their environment using an automated pipeline. Each of these modules
                            are self-contained logical resources (Kubernetes clusters, databases, message queues, etc.)
                            and include all of the configuration necessary to be secure, redundant and scalable by
                            design. Besides my primary role, I'm also working to get an internal red-teaming effort off
                            the ground within our organisation.

                            I've been able to dive deeply into the AWS ecosystem working with almost all "primary" AWS
                            services: EC2, VPC, CloudFormation, EKS, Lambda, S3, RDS, IAM, CloudTrail, CloudWatch and
                            many more. Our platform is written primarily in Python, uses Git for version control and is
                            deployed using Jenkins. Infrastructure-as-code is written either in CloudFormation or
                            Terraform. Applications are run as containers on Kubernetes, and we're also working with
                            Cloudflare to protect our infrastructure.

                            curriculum teaches students in a number of disciplines including computer science,
                            electrical engineering, industrial design, mathematics. Besides purely technical skills,
                            students are also taught to apply this multi-domain knowledge to project planning and
                            inter-disciplinary communication. This combination of technical and professional skills
                            trains students to be technically adept, communicative and self-reliant.
