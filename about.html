        <h3>Hey! üëãüèº</h3>

        <p>
            I'm a nerd from the Netherlands. üá≥üá± I am curious, communicative, always looking to learn and eager to try
            new and challenging things. My professional interest revolves mainly around computers with a focus on
            security, networking and infrastructure. Other than that I also love to build my own PC, play video games,
            learn about (astro)physics and
            <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonathanjuursema/albums" target="_blank">do some photography</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I love to go outside.Ô∏è I try to be active multiple times a week by climbing, running and other activities. I
            enjoy traveling, and try to go on a winter sports and/or diving vacation at least once a year. In 2020, I
            took three months off to
            <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jonathanjuursema/albums/72157712706245321" target="_blank">go
                to New Zealand</a> and travel around in a converted campervan.
        </p>

        <p>
            During my <a href="/experience.html#education">studies</a> I've spent a lot of time I should have spent
            studying
            getting involved in various <a href="/experience.html#volunteering"> associations and organisations</a>.
            Even
            though it's been some time since I graduated I still feel connected to many of them and I try to help
            whenever I can. I firmly believe that these associations and organisations have contributed just as much to
            my personal and professional growth as my studies did.
